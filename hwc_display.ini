# 0:0+1+2+3 - ALl planes of display 0 are used for HWC before EHL.

# A typical usages:
#   there are 3 physical displays(ports? crtc? pipe?), the first one and third one are connected, the second one is disconnected
#   use:
#       LOGICAL_DISPLAY="0:3"
#       LOGICAL_DISPLAY="1:2"
#   to split the physical displays, the final logical displays number will be "0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5", "3, 4" belongs to
#   second physical display and is disconnected, so available displays number are "0, 1, 2, 5"
#   use:
#       MOSAIC_DISPLAY="2+5"
#       MOSAIC_DISPLAY="0+3+4"
#   the final mosaic display will be (keep the order by the smallest logical display num):
#       MOSAIC_DISPLAY 0: includes 1 logical display(logical display 0) only
#       MOSAIC_DISPLAY 1: includes 2 and 5 logical displays (5 is the third physical display without split displays)
#   the logical display 1 is not used for mosaic display, will be second display of the final available display.
